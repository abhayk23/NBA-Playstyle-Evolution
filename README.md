Has the NBA experienced a shift in playstyle from 2000-2009 to 2010-2019?
This analysis examines playstyle evolution in Python using **hypothesis testing** and **ANOVA analysis**. Additionally, we conducted **time series analyses** to assess statistical trends over 20 years, and **KMeans clustering** to categorize players by playstyle and discern differences between decades.
